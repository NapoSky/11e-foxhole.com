## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the project**: Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the GitHub page to create your own copy of the project.

2. **Create a branch**: 
   - Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub.
   - Click on the branch dropdown menu, typically labeled "main" or "master".
   - In the dropdown, type the name of your new branch following the format "feat/<TheChange>" and press "Enter" to create the branch.

3. **Make your changes**:
   - In your new branch, navigate to the files you need to modify. For example:
     - Text files used for translation are in `src/locales/<lang>/common.json`.
     - Images are stored in `src/images` and will be rendered later in `public/images`. All images should be in webp format, compressed, and named using the convention `imageName-size.webp` or `imageName-lang-size.webp` for locale-specific images.
   - Use GitHub's web-based editor to make changes directly on the site.

4. **Commit your changes**:

   - Navigate to the "Pull Requests" tab in your forked repository.
   - Click "New Pull Request" and select your branch with the changes.
